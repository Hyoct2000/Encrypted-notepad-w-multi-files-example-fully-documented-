# Encrypted-notepad-w-multi-files-example-fully-documented-
AES 256 encrypted notepad example made in CF2.5+

I made a fully documented, open source example project file that showcase all the core systems that involve an encrypted multiple note-taking program. These systems are put into practice with my newly released app, AESPAD.

This is incredibly useful for beginners looking forward deepening their Fusion programming knowledge, or just advanced Fusion developers looking for related systems to the matter or contributing to it.
Here you'll learn the AESFusion object, complex ini file structures and data management, ForEach loops, spread values to assign identifiers to an active, the use of loops and timers, GoE's flow, and applying mathematical functions to the fusion scripting language within the expression editor to pull off more complex programming.
The only thing missing is the lock screen, just because I don't consider it strictly related to the core systems. However, it's quite simple to do and you can add it if you want.

I hope you find it useful! No credits are needed. Feel free to contribute :)
